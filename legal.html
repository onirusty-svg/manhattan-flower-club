  <!-- ABOUT US -->
  <section id="about">
    <h2>About Manhattan Flower Club</h2>

    <p>
      Manhattan Flower Club is a refined floral house where each arrangement is treated as a statement of
      elegance, emotion, and intention. Inspired by the timeless sophistication of New York and the intimacy
      of private members’ clubs, we curate florals that transcend trends.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every petal tells a story — of craftsmanship, discretion, and luxury. Our designs are created for those
      who value beauty as an experience rather than a commodity.
    </p>

    <p>
      We believe flowers are not merely gifts, but gestures. Symbols of access, celebration, desire, and
      distinction.
